### Project Overview:
        This app consists of three main components which are-
        1. Customers =>
              It renders a paginated table having 10 entries per page based on the customers data available.
              
      2. Orders' Total Price Vs Date =>
              It renders a Line graph between total price of various orders per day and date on which these orders have been placed.
              
       3. Orders' Count Vs Date => 
              It renders a Bar graph between total number of orders placed per day and date on which these orders have been placed.
              
        I also accommodated error handling in this app, which means if anyone tries to enter a different route apart from given ones then the app will render an error page saying "Page Not Found".
